        <p><b>What is XPath Designer?</b></p>
        <p>XPath Designer is tool which helps you rapidly create precise XPath expressions with little effort.</p>
        <p><b>How do I use it?</b></p>
        <p>XPath Designer is intended to be used in conjunction with the inspect element tool in your web browser.
            The software is very intuitive, some things are much easier understood after a bit of hands-on tinkering
            rather than reading an explanation.</p>
        <p><b>Analyze</b></p>
        <p>Use the inspect element tool to identify an element that you wish to locate. Copy the html of that element,
            then paste the html in the ‘Input’ field in XPath Designer, then click on the ‘Analyze’ button.
            The ‘Tag’ field will automatically be filled with the tag name of that element and the Attribute table will
            automatically be populated with the attributes of the element.</p>
        <p>If you remove the text in the ‘Tag’ textbox, then the resulting XPath will use a wildcard so that all element
            types will be matched.</p>
        <p><b>Delete Mode</b></p>
        <p>You can now look through the attributes in the Attribute table and remove whatever Attributes that you don’t
            want to use to locate the element. To remove a row in the Attribute table, click on the ‘Delete mode’
            checkbox, then click on the rows that you wish to remove, then click the ‘Delete mode’ checkbox again to
            disable delete mode.</p>
        <p><b>Match Type</b></p>
        <p>You can change the ‘Match type’ of each attribute in the Attribute table, and modify the
            ‘Value’ of the attribute in regard to the match type that you have chosen.</p>
        <p>Equals means that the value must be an exact match.</p>
        <p>Contains means that the attributes value must at least contain the given text.</p>
        <p>Starts-with means that the attributes value must begin with the given text.</p>
        <p>Ends-with means that the attributes value must end with the given text.</p>
        <p>If you remove the text inside of the 'Value' textbox, then the resulting XPath will use a wildcard so that
            the XPath will find elements with an attribute name that exactly match the text in the ‘Name’ textbox. In
            this case ‘Match type’ will be ignored since only exact match is possible.</p>
        <p>Likewise, if you remove the text inside of the ‘Name’ textbox, the XPath designer will use a wildcard to find
            elements with an attribute value that matches the text in the ‘Value’ textbox depending on which ‘Match
            type’
            that has been selected.</p>
        <p><b>Separator</b></p>

        <p>A Separator represents an ‘or’ operator in XPath. You can click on the ‘Separator’ button to add a separator
            to the Attribute table. You can then drag and drop the separator into the position that you want in the
            Attribute table. When two or more rows in the attribute table are directly above or below each other without
            a separator inserted in between, they will be joined with an ‘and’ operator in the resulting XPath.</p>
        <p><b>Drag and Drop</b></p>
        <p>On the left side of each attribute row in the Attribute table there is a black bar. If you want to
            re-arrange the order of the attributes, you can drag and drop them using this black bar.</p>

        <p><b>Add to list</b></p>
        <p>When you have finished editing the Attribute table, you can click on the ‘Add to list’ button. The resulting
            XPath expression will then appear in the ‘XPath List’ on the right-hand side of XPath Designer. You can add
            as many items to the XPath List as you
            want. You can also rearrange the items in the list by dragging and dropping them, and remove items using
            ‘Delete Mode’.
        </p>
        <p><b>Move to level</b></p>
        <p>If you want to move up into higher level, or move down into a specific lower level you can use the 'Move to
            level' feature.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the inspect element tool on your web browser find and copy the Full XPath of the element that you
                are starting with, and paste it into the textbox in XPath Designer labelled ‘Full XPath 1’.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process again for the element that you wish to move to, and paste it into ‘Full XPath 2’.
            </li>
            <li>Click on ‘Add to list’, and the level moving XPath will appear in the ‘XPath List’.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Index</b></p>
        <p>If your resulting XPath finds multiple elements but you only want to find one specific element, you can use
            the Index feature, then click on ‘Get XPath’ to update the output text box.</p>
        <p><b>Output</b></p>
        <p>When you click on the ‘Get XPath’ button, all the items from the ‘XPath List’ are joined together in the same
            order that they appear in the XPath List, and the
            result is displayed in the output text box.</p>
        Now you can test the resulting XPath to see if it successfully locates the element/s.
        <ol>
            <li>Copy the XPath to your clipboard.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the webpage that you want to test it on.</li>
            <li>Open the inspect element tool. Then press ‘control + f’ to open the search box. Then paste your XPath
                into the search field.</li>
        </ol>
